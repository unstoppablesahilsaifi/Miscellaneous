1. Thread Dump:
A thread dump is like taking a snapshot of what all the workers (threads) are doing in a factory (your software).
It shows what each worker is currently working on and where they are in their tasks.
It helps developers identify any problems, like workers getting stuck or waiting for something for too long, causing delays or performance issues in the software.
This snapshot helps find and fix these issues to make the software run smoother and more efficiently.
 
Use cases:
 
a).Identifying thread-related issues: A thread dump can help pinpoint deadlocks or threads that are stuck or taking excessive CPU time, leading to performance problems.
 
b).Analyzing thread behavior: It allows developers to inspect the execution flow of threads and helps identify potential bottlenecks or synchronization issues.

2. Heap Dump:
A heap dump is like taking a picture of all the things (objects) stored in a big box (memory) in your computer when your software is running.
It helps developers see what's inside that box and how much space each thing is taking up.
This snapshot is useful for finding memory-related problems, like when something is using too much space and causing the software to run out of memory.
By analyzing the heap dump, developers can optimize memory usage and make the software run better.
 
                    or(Below second definition)
A heap dump is a snapshot of the Java heap memory at a specific point in time.
It contains information about all objects and their references stored in the JVM's heap, including their size and relationships.
Heap dumps are used to analyze memory-related issues, such as memory leaks or excessive memory usage.
 
Use cases:
 
a).Identifying memory leaks: A heap dump helps identify objects that are not properly garbage-collected, leading to memory leaks and increased memory usage over time.

b).Analyzing memory usage: Developers can inspect the size and types of objects in memory, helping them optimize memory consumption and improve application performance.
